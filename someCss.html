<p1> <img src="http://coldplay.com/wp-content/themes/ahfod/images/Coldplay_new2.gif" alt="Drumming" width="170" height="170">
    Coldplay is a British rock band formed in 1996 by lead vocalist and keyboardist
     Chris Martin and lead guitarist Jonny Buckland at University College London (UCL).
      After they formed under the name Pectoralz, Guy Berryman joined the group as 
      bassist and they changed their name to Starfish. Will Champion joined as 
      drummer and backing vocalist, completing the lineup. Creative director 
      Phil Harvey is often referred to as the fifth member by the band. The band 
      renamed themselves "Coldplay" in 1998, before recording and releasing three 
      EPs: Safety in 1998 and Brothers & Sisters and The Blue Room in 1999. The Blue
       Room was their first release on a major label, after signing to Parlophone.</p1>
