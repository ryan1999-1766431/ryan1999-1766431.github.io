        This is my first html web page. Although I don't have any prior coding

    <p>
    This is my favorite song for all time. I've learned to played the acoustic version of it, and I even attend 
    the Coldplay concert when I arrived in Seattle.

    <p>
    Beside music, I also love to play sports. One of my favorite sports is volleyball. I am planning to join the UW men's volleyball club.
    Here's a video that I found incredible and entertaining.

    I used to do cyclying. I had once cycled around Taiwan in 8 days, during the coldest time in the year. Here is a small and entertaining video of us
    taking our break while cycling around the island.
